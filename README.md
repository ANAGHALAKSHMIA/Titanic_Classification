# Titanic Classification
Welcome to the Titanic Classification repository! 
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not by applying machine learning techniques to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains details such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.
